## Context
Kittme is a game that was conceived and realized in the context of GameJam 2023, which took place during the weekend from March, 3rd to 5th. The theme of this edition was "Break the Rules". We made Kittme with Unity game engine, that we all learnt to use on the job, by doing this project.
